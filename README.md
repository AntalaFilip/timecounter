# TimeCounter
### A configurable, accessible clock. 
TimeCounter is an easy to deploy and easy to manage application for hosting time that can be easily manipulated with.   
A single TimeCounter instance (deployment) supports multiple separate Counters (clocks).    
Each Counter has its own time, as configured by its administrator. The time can be paused and sped up/slowed down.  
You can take a look at the [live demo](https://timecounter.live.ahst.sk).
